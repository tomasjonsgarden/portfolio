		<h2>About</h2>
		<!--<p>{{data.bio}}</p>-->
		<p>It’s not by coincidence that Tomas Jonsgarden’s life path has led him to filmmaking. Born into a family of Academia, Tomas
			was raised to question and to wonder – it was the gift of this wondering mind that turned his interest from music to photography
			to filmmaking. Knowing he would have to break out of his small town of Uppsala Sweden, where he attended and graduated
			from the University, Tomas took residence to Stockholm.</p>

		<p>Tomas began working as a director’s assistant at Pettersson Akerlund Film where he would rub shoulders with directors such
			as Jonas Akerlund; and the influence was great. The desire to further grow his knowledge and aesthetic eye led to a job
			as a photographer’s assistant. After years as assistant to, amongst others, fashion photographer Mattias Edwall, Tomas
			began shooting advertising and editorial for hire.</p>

		<p>Restless with the constraints of still photography Tomas’ ambition to direct commercials took a big leap forward when he
			got offered to start working as a director at the production company Forsberg & Co, in Stockholm 2001. It is here that
			Tomas began to hone in on his personal style through a variety of commercials, music videos and a few longer form jobs
			for Swedish Television.</p>

		<p>In 2007 Tomas was voted ”The Most Successful Commercial Director” in Sweden from both the major ad agencies and by a renowned
			ad-magazine. In the same year Tomas navigated through the tricky game of directing the high profile actor Richard Gere
			in a KappAhl commercial. The collaboration was so successful that the superstar insisted Tomas to direct his next commercial
			project.</p>

		<p>Tomas has a way of making everyday moments epic by capturing the subtle twitches of humanity that makes us laugh, cry or
			blush when we recognize ourselves in them. It takes a great director to imitate those small gestures and mini-expressions
			for the screen and it is something that has earned him awards at shows like Cannes Lions, Epica, Eurobest and New York
			Festivals amongst others.</p>
